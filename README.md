Thank you for sharing the link:  
[https://github.com/dubeyaditya9452/LandingPage/blob/main/Desktop/Assignment1/Assignment1/index.html](https://github.com/dubeyaditya9452/LandingPage/blob/main/Desktop/Assignment1/Assignment1/index.html)

This confirms that your `index.html` is located at `Desktop/Assignment1/Assignment1/index.html` **inside your repository**.  
**For GitHub Pages to work, your `index.html` must be in the root of the repository, not in a subfolder.**

---

## **How to Fix This**

### 1. Move Files to the Root

You need to move all files from `Desktop/Assignment1/Assignment1/` to `Desktop/Assignment1/` in your repository.

### 2. Steps to Fix

1. **Move the files:**
   - Move `index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`, and any other site files from `Assignment1/Assignment1/` to `Assignment1/`.
2. **Delete the now-empty `Assignment1/Assignment1/` folder.**
3. **Commit and push the changes:**
   ```sh
   git add .
   git commit -m "Move site files to root for GitHub Pages"
   git push
   ```
4. **On GitHub:**
   - Go to **Settings** > **Pages**.
   - Set the source to `main` branch and `/ (root)` folder.
   - Save and wait a few minutes.

### **Result**
Your site will then be available at:  
`https://dubeyaditya9452.github.io/LandingPage/`

---

**Summary:**  
Your current structure is too deep for GitHub Pages. Move your site files up one level so `index.html` is directly in the root of the repository, then push and update your Pages settings.
